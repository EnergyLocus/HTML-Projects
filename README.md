## [Timer](/Timer)

Simple timer that can count down upto days, hours, minutes, and seconds.<br>
For now you'll have to edit the code to set time. I'm working on a form that will accept that date and time.

## [Kalamkari-Clone](/Kalamkari-clone)

This clone is created from the [Kalamkari Website](https://kalamkari.vercel.app)

## [Video Player](/Video-Player)

This project is used to play any video or music link directly into the browser which otherwise is downloaded by default.<br>
Due to lack of my knowledge in JS, I can't actually program it to check if the link enterend is of video or music or not a multimedia link.
